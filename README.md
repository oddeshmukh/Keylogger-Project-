# Keylogger-Project-
 Python Keylogger with Remote Logging Server  This project demonstrates a basic keylogger in Python (`keyloggerdk.py`) that captures keystrokes from a user machine and sends them over HTTP to a central logging server (`store_keystrokes_server.py`). The server stores the logs in a timestamped file (`keystrokes.log`).
